# Assassins

Our project, Assassins, is an tool for social and professional groups to play a
team-building activity. We have taken the popular real-life game of Assassins and
translated it into a mobile and smart watch application. Through this app, individuals in
an organization and get to know the other members of their team in a meaningful way.
 Although our primary stakeholders are small groups such as start-ups, almost
anybody can use this application. Users simply need to register, find their friends, and
start a game. Games can then be customized to fit the playersâ€™ needs: users can shuffle
targets, change kill assignments, and receive instantaneous notification changes.
 Assassins hopes to change the realm of team-building activities.. Unlike any other
team-building application currently in the market, Assassins allows all members of the
team to participate and does not require a whole day to be set aside in order to do the
acticity. We hope that this application allows individuals to get to know one another in a
fun and unique way.
